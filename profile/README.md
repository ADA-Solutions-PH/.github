# ADA Solutions PH

Hey there ðŸ‘‹ We're **ADA Solutions PH** â€” a group of three friends from the Philippines who love building things together.

This is our digital garage where we tinker with code, design little experiments, and try to ship cool (and sometimes ridiculous) ideas. Whether itâ€™s a tool to make life easier or just a random project we cooked up on a call â€” youâ€™ll find it here.

## Who we are

- **Anne** â€“ [@axsulit](https://github.com/axsulit)  
- **Doms** â€“ [@dlmbaccay](https://github.com/dlmbaccay)  
- **Andre** â€“ [@karlaquino](https://github.com/karlaquino)  

We're all about exploring ideas, solving problems, and having fun while doing it. Whether it's a useful app or a random tool we thought would be cool to build, you'll find it here.

Thanks for stopping by! ðŸ’»âœ¨
