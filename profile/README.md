# ADA Solutions PH

Hey there ðŸ‘‹ We're **ADA Solutions PH** â€” a group of three friends from the Philippines who love building things together.

We work on side projects that help us learn, grow our skills, and (hopefully) turn into something bigger one day. Think of this space as our little garage where we tinker, code, design, and experiment with dumb ideas.

## Who we are

- **Anne** â€“ [@axsulit](https://github.com/axsulit)  
- **Doms** â€“ [@dlmbaccay](https://github.com/dlmbaccay)  
- **Andre** â€“ [@karlaquino](https://github.com/karlaquino)  

We're all about exploring ideas, solving problems, and having fun while doing it. Whether it's a useful app or a random tool we thought would be cool to build, you'll find it here.

Thanks for stopping by! ðŸ’»âœ¨
